<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="{{media_url('images/wedding.jpg')}}">
<br>My wife, Sarah, and I were married in May 2013.</p>

<p id="about">I grew up just outside <a
href="http://www.bestoftheroad.com/town/jefferson-city-mo/3747">Jefferson
City, MO</a>, and received my B.S. in
physics from <a href="http://www.truman.edu/">Truman State
University</a> in 2009.  I received my Ph.D. in
computational astrophysics from the University of Texas at Austin in May of 2016, where I worked with <a
href="http://www.as.utexas.edu/~vbromm/">Volker Bromm</a> studying the
formation of the first stars in the universe.  You can find out more
about my research interests <a href="{{ content_url('research.html')
}}">here</small></a>.</p>


<p id="about">More broadly, I'm fascinated by the challenges involved in performing exploratory data analysis on 'out-of-core' datasets and the intricacies of effective data visualization.</p>

<p id="about">When I'm not working, I enjoy running, tacos, playing volleyball and ultimate
frisbee, riding my motorcycle through the
beautiful Texas hill country, and exploring all the wonderful things
Austin has to offer (especially the Tex-Mex :-). </p>
