<p>I study the formation of the first stars in the Universe.  Their formation lit up the Universe, marking the end of a period often referred to as the Cosmic Dark Ages.  As the first sources of light since the Big Bang, the first stars set the stage for all subsequent episodes of star&mdash;and eventually galaxy&mdash;formation.  The light from the first stars heated and ionized the surrounding gas from which the next generation of stars would form, altering their formation process, and possibly changing the type of stars formed from the first generation to the second.  </p>


<p>I am particularly interested in the details of this process: how does radiative feedback from the first generation of stars affect the subsequent star formation process at nearby sites?  I approach this problem by performing numerical Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics simulations using the code GADGET-2.  By implementing a prescription for what impact radiation from the <em>very</em> first stars would have on the gas in these second-generation star formation sites, we can gain insight into what, if any, differences there are between first- and second-generations stars.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of this line of inquiry is to develop a more complete understanding of how the first galaxies form.  Just like the first stars, the first galaxies set the stage for all subsequent galaxy formation, eventually leading to our own Milky Way Galaxy.  The difficulty in studying this epoch of cosmic time is that, as yet, we have no empirical data (i.e., observations) against which to test our models.  With the advent of powerful next-generation space- and ground-based observatories though, particularly the James Webb Space Telescope, we will be able to push the frontiers of our knowledge to a mere 500 million years after the Big Bang, when the first galaxies were forming.  Once these observatories come online and bridge the remaining gap in our knowledge, we will be able to construct a complete timeline of the history of our universe.
